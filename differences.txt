Understand and Illustrate Difference between

a. Stored Procedure vs function
    Function returns value, stored procedure may not.
    Functions allow only select, stored procedure allows insert,update and delete as well.

b. Clustered vs non clustered index
    Clustered index determines physical order of data.
    only one clustered index per table.

    can have multiple non-clustered index per table.
    non-clustered index analogous to index in text book.

c. Delete vs truncate vs drop
    delete can delete conditionally
    truncate delete all rows
    drop deletes all rows as well as the table.

d. Where vs having
    where filters records from table.
    having is used with group by. It filters records from groups.

e. Primary key vs unique key
    Primary key is unique and not null. Only one Primary Key per table.
    Can have multiple unique keys. Unique key can contain one null value.

f. Local temporary table vs global temporary table
    local temporary table names start with #, available only in the session in which it is created.
    global temporary table names start with ##, available across multiple sessions.

g. Union vs union all
    union removes duplicates, union all keeps duplicates

h. Join vs union
    join combine data from multiple tables.
    union combine data from multiple select.

i. Count(1) vs count(*) vs count(col_name)
    count(1) and count(*) are identical. They count all rows.
    count(col_name) count the rows in which col_name is not null.

j. rank, row_number vs dense_rank
    rank skips position in case of ties. so rank may not be consecutive.
    dense rank does not skip, so dense rank is consecutive.
    row_number gives a different number to each record within a partition.
